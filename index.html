<h2>Emergency room services, inpatient care, labs, and specialists</h2>

<h3>Comprehensive care pathways at Centenary Hospital</h3>
<p>Centenary Hospital emergency services are designed to provide rapid assessment, stabilization, and treatment for patients experiencing urgent medical conditions. When you arrive at the emergency department, a triage nurse will assess the severity of your symptoms and assign a priority level based on clinical need. This ensures that patients with life-threatening conditions receive immediate attention while those with less urgent issues are seen as capacity allows. Emergency room services include diagnostic imaging, laboratory testing, medication administration, wound care, and consultation with specialists when required. Our emergency physicians and nurses work collaboratively to determine whether a patient can be safely discharged with follow-up instructions or requires admission to an inpatient unit for ongoing care.</p>

<p>Inpatient hospital services at Centenary Hospital provide around-the-clock care for patients who require ongoing monitoring, treatment, and support beyond what can be provided in an outpatient or emergency setting. Once admitted, patients are assigned to a unit based on their clinical needs, and a care team—including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and allied health professionals—coordinates all aspects of treatment. Daily rounds allow the team to review progress, adjust medications, order additional tests, and plan for discharge. Discharge planning begins early in the admission process to ensure that patients have the supports, medications, follow-up appointments, and education they need for a safe transition home or to another care setting.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Patient-centred care means listening to patients and families, respecting their values and preferences, and involving them as partners in every decision. At Centenary Hospital, we are committed to delivering care that is safe, effective, timely, and compassionate.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Hospital laboratory services and specialist medical care</h3>
<p>Hospital laboratory services play a critical role in diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and patient safety. Blood tests, urinalysis, microbiology cultures, and other diagnostic specimens are processed by our laboratory team to provide clinicians with the information they need to make informed decisions. Results are reviewed promptly, and abnormal findings trigger clinical follow-up to adjust treatment plans as needed. Laboratory services support both emergency room services and inpatient hospital services, ensuring that testing is available when and where it is needed most.</p>

<p>Specialist medical care at Centenary Hospital is accessed through referral pathways coordinated by primary care providers or emergency physicians. Specialists in fields such as cardiology, respirology, surgery, internal medicine, and other disciplines provide consultations, diagnostic assessments, and treatment plans for complex or chronic conditions. In the inpatient setting, specialists may co-manage patients alongside the primary care team, offering expertise that enhances outcomes and supports safe discharge. Outpatient specialist clinics allow for ongoing follow-up and monitoring after discharge, ensuring continuity of care across the healthcare system.

<h2>Hospital admission process and visiting hours in Canada</h2>

<h3>Understanding the admission process</h3>
<p>The hospital admission process at Centenary Hospital is designed to ensure that every patient receives appropriate care in a timely and coordinated manner. Admissions may occur through the emergency department when a patient's condition requires ongoing inpatient treatment, or they may be planned in advance for scheduled procedures or treatments. Regardless of the pathway, the admission process follows a structured sequence that includes registration, clinical assessment, bed assignment, and discharge planning. Understanding what to expect at each stage can help patients and families feel more prepared and engaged in their care.</p>

<p>Upon arrival for admission, patients will be asked to provide identification, health insurance information, and contact details for next of kin or emergency contacts. Registration staff will verify coverage and create or update the patient's medical record. A nursing assessment follows, during which vital signs are measured, symptoms are documented, and a medication history is taken. Physicians will conduct a clinical assessment, order diagnostic tests as needed, and develop an initial treatment plan. Once a bed is available, the patient will be assigned to an appropriate unit based on their clinical needs and the level of monitoring or intervention required. Throughout the stay, the care team will provide updates, involve the patient and family in decision-making, and begin planning for discharge from the first day of admission.</p>

<h3>Visiting hours and visitor guidance</h3>
<p>Hospital visiting hours at Centenary Hospital are established to balance the needs of patients for rest and recovery with the important role that family and friends play in providing emotional support and participating in care. Visiting hours may vary by unit, and some areas—such as intensive care or isolation units—may have additional restrictions to protect patient safety and privacy. Visitors are encouraged to check with the nursing station upon arrival to confirm current visiting policies and any unit-specific guidelines.</p>

<details>
<summary>Visiting guidance and accessibility considerations</summary>
<p>All visitors are expected to follow infection prevention and control measures, which may include hand hygiene, masking, and health screening at entry points. Visitors who are unwell or experiencing symptoms of infectious illness should postpone their visit to protect vulnerable patients. Quiet hours are typically observed during early morning and evening to support patient rest, and visitors are asked to minimize noise and respect the privacy of other patients in shared rooms.</p>
<p>Centenary Hospital is committed to accessibility and will work with patients and families to accommodate visitors with disabilities, language needs, or other considerations. Compassionate exceptions to visiting policies may be made for end-of-life care, pediatric patients, or patients with cognitive or sensory impairments who benefit from the presence of a support person. Speak with the care team to discuss individual needs and arrange appropriate accommodations.</p>

<h2>Centenary Hospital locations and the Canadian hospital network</h2>

<h3>Access points and care coordination</h3>
<p>Centenary Hospital locations serve as access points for a range of healthcare services, from emergency care to planned specialist consultations. While the physical sites and facilities are distributed to meet community needs, all locations operate under shared standards for quality, safety, and patient-centred care. Understanding how to access different services—and what to expect at each type of location—can help patients navigate the healthcare system more effectively and ensure they receive the right care at the right time.</p>

<p>The Canadian hospital network is built on principles of integration and coordination. Centenary Hospital works closely with primary care providers, community health centres, long-term care facilities, and other acute care hospitals to ensure that patients experience seamless transitions across care settings. Referrals, shared electronic health records, and interprofessional communication support continuity of care, reducing duplication of tests and ensuring that all providers have access to the information they need. Whether a patient is being transferred from another hospital, referred by a family physician, or arriving independently at the emergency department, Centenary Hospital is committed to coordinated, patient-centred care.</p>

<h3>Location types and how patients access services</h3>
<p>Healthcare facilities Canada include a variety of location types, each serving a distinct purpose within the care continuum. At Centenary Hospital, patients may interact with emergency departments, inpatient units, outpatient clinics, and laboratory services depending on their clinical needs and the pathway through which they enter the system. Understanding these location types and how they are accessed can help patients and families prepare for appointments, admissions, and follow-up care.</p>

<h3>Referrals, continuity, and next steps</h3>
<p>Centenary Hospital appointments for specialist consultations and outpatient services are typically arranged through referral from a primary care provider. Referrals ensure that the specialist has relevant clinical information and that the appointment is appropriate for the patient's needs. Patients should bring their referral documentation, a list of current medications, and any recent test results to their appointment to support efficient and effective care. For patients who do not have a primary care provider, emergency department physicians or hospital-based clinicians can initiate referrals as part of discharge planning.</p>

<p>Continuity of care is a priority across the Canadian hospital network. After discharge from Centenary Hospital, patients may be referred to community-based services, rehabilitation programs, home care, or outpatient follow-up with specialists. Discharge summaries are shared with primary care providers and other members of the care team to ensure that everyone involved in the patient's care has access to up-to-date information. Patients are encouraged to attend all follow-up appointments, fill prescriptions as directed, and contact their care team if they have questions or concerns during recovery.
