<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<details>
<summary>What services does Centenary Hospital provide?</summary>
<div>
<p>Centenary Hospital offers comprehensive healthcare services including emergency care, inpatient treatment, laboratory services, and specialist consultations across multiple departments. Our centenary hospital emergency services provide urgent assessment, stabilization, and diagnostics for patients with acute medical needs. Inpatient hospital services support patients requiring admission for monitoring, treatment, and coordinated care planning. Hospital laboratory services deliver timely bloodwork and specimen testing to inform clinical decisions, while specialist medical care ensures that complex conditions receive expert attention and coordinated treatment plans.</p>
<p>Each service area is designed to integrate seamlessly within the broader care journey. Emergency room services triage patients based on clinical urgency, and those requiring further care are admitted to inpatient units where multidisciplinary teams manage treatment and discharge planning. Specialist medical care may be accessed through referral or as part of inpatient co-management, ensuring that patients benefit from expertise across disciplines. For more detail on how these services connect, visit our <a href="/">services overview page</a>.</p>
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I schedule an appointment at Centenary Hospital?</summary>
<div>
<p>You can book appointments through the hospital's scheduling channels. If a referral is required, confirm the referral details with your primary care provider and bring relevant records to support timely specialist medical care. Centenary hospital appointments may be arranged for outpatient clinics, specialist consultations, or follow-up visits after inpatient care. When scheduling, have your health card, contact information, and any prior test results ready to streamline the process.</p>
<p>For patients navigating healthcare facilities Canada, it is important to understand whether your appointment requires a physician referral or can be booked directly. Referral-based specialist medical care typically involves coordination between your family doctor and the hospital, ensuring that the specialist has the necessary background to provide focused, efficient care. If you have questions about the referral process or need clarification on what to bring, consult the <a href="/about-us">locations and access section</a> of our About page.</p>
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>When should I use emergency room services versus urgent care?</summary>
<div>
<p>Use emergency room services for severe symptoms, breathing difficulty, chest pain, major injury, or sudden neurological changes. For less severe issues, consider community options when available and follow provincial guidance for Canada. Centenary hospital emergency services are designed for life-threatening or potentially life-threatening conditions that require immediate medical intervention, advanced diagnostics, and the possibility of hospital admission.</p>
<p>Understanding when to seek emergency care versus other options helps ensure that resources are available for those with the most urgent needs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage">Triage</a> protocols prioritize patients based on clinical severity, so wait times in the emergency department reflect the acuity of cases being treated. If you are unsure whether your symptoms warrant emergency room services, contact your primary care provider or consult public health guidance. For more information on centenary hospital canada emergency pathways, see our <a href="/">emergency services overview</a>.</p>
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the hospital admission process like for inpatient care?</summary>
<div>
<p>The hospital admission process typically includes registration, clinical assessment, diagnostics, bed assignment, and discharge planning. Inpatient hospital services focus on safe treatment, monitoring, and coordinated follow-up. Upon arrival, patients provide identification and health coverage details, and a nursing and physician team conducts an initial assessment to determine the appropriate level of care. Diagnostic tests such as bloodwork, imaging, or other hospital laboratory services may be ordered to guide treatment decisions.</p>
<p>Once a bed is assigned, the care team develops a treatment plan that includes medication management, monitoring, and preparation for discharge. Discharge planning begins early in the admission, with the team coordinating follow-up appointments, home care supports, and patient education to ensure a smooth transition. Patients and families are encouraged to ask questions, clarify instructions, and confirm next steps. For a detailed breakdown of admission stages and what to bring, refer to the <a href="/">hospital admission process section</a> on our home page.</p>
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do hospital visiting hours work and what should visitors know?</summary>
<div>
<p>Hospital visiting hours may vary by unit and patient needs. Visitors should follow infection prevention guidance, respect quiet hours, and coordinate with the care team for accessibility or compassionate exceptions. Hospital patient care is supported by a safe, healing environment, and visiting policies are designed to balance family involvement with patient rest and clinical workflows. Some units may have restricted hours to allow for procedures, rounds, or rest periods, while others may offer more flexible access depending on patient condition and care requirements.</p>
<p>Visitors play an important role in supporting recovery and communication, and healthcare facilities Canada recognize the value of family presence. However, infection prevention measures such as hand hygiene, masking when indicated, and screening protocols help protect vulnerable patients. If you have specific needs related to accessibility, language support, or compassionate care exceptions, speak with the nursing team or patient relations. For more guidance on hospital visiting hours and patient support, visit our <a href="/about-us">About Us page</a>.</p>
</div>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How are laboratory services used during emergency and inpatient care?</summary>
<div>
<p>Hospital laboratory services support diagnosis and monitoring through bloodwork and other tests. Results are interpreted by clinicians and integrated into treatment decisions for emergency services and inpatient care. In the emergency department, rapid lab results help determine the cause of symptoms, guide immediate interventions, and inform decisions about admission or discharge. During inpatient hospital services, ongoing lab monitoring tracks response to treatment, detects complications, and supports safe medication management.</p>
<p>Centenary hospital emergency services and inpatient units rely on timely, accurate laboratory data to deliver evidence-based care. Patients may be asked to provide blood, urine, or other specimens at various points in their care journey, and understanding the purpose of these tests can help reduce anxiety and improve cooperation. If you have questions about why a test was ordered or what the results mean, ask your care team for clarification. External resources such as the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/health.html">Government of Canada health services page</a> provide additional context on diagnostic stewardship and patient safety.</p>
