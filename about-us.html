<h1>About Centenary Hospital Canada: Locations and Care Approach</h1>

<section id="breadcrumbs-intro">
<h2>Mandate, governance, and patient-centred standards</h2>

<p>Centenary Hospital is a Canadian healthcare institution committed to delivering safe, equitable, and coordinated hospital patient care across emergency, inpatient, laboratory, and specialist services. As part of the broader Canadian hospital network, Centenary Hospital operates under provincial health mandates and national quality standards to ensure that every patient receives evidence-based treatment, compassionate support, and continuity of care throughout their healthcare journey. Our governance structure emphasizes accountability, transparency, and collaboration with regional health authorities, professional colleges, and community partners to advance health outcomes for the populations we serve.</p>

<p>The hospital's mission centers on patient-centred care that respects individual needs, cultural backgrounds, and clinical complexity. Centenary Hospital Canada integrates acute care hospital services with preventive health initiatives, chronic disease management, and post-discharge support to reduce fragmentation and improve long-term wellness. Our clinical teams—comprising physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, and support staff—work within interprofessional models that prioritize communication, shared decision-making, and respect for patient autonomy. This approach aligns with guidance from the <a href="https://www.cihi.ca/en" rel="external">Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI)</a>, which tracks hospital performance and promotes best practices across healthcare facilities Canada.</p>

<p>Centenary Hospital adheres to rigorous safety protocols, infection prevention standards, and quality improvement frameworks informed by national and international benchmarks. We participate in accreditation programs, clinical audits, and patient experience surveys to identify opportunities for enhancement and to ensure that our services meet or exceed expectations. Our commitment to equity means addressing barriers to access, providing language interpretation and accessibility supports, and tailoring care plans to the social determinants of health that influence recovery and well-being. By embedding these principles into daily operations, Centenary Hospital strives to be a trusted partner in the health of individuals, families, and communities across Canada.</p>

<section id="access-locations">
<h2>Centenary Hospital locations, access, and referrals</h2>

<h3>How patients access Centenary Hospital services</h3>

<p>Centenary Hospital locations are designed to provide multiple points of access across the continuum of care, from urgent emergency department visits to planned specialist consultations and inpatient admissions. Patients may enter the healthcare system through the emergency department for acute symptoms requiring immediate assessment, through referral pathways for specialist medical care, or via scheduled admissions for procedures and treatments that have been coordinated in advance. Each access channel is supported by clinical protocols, administrative processes, and patient navigation resources to ensure timely, appropriate care within the broader framework of healthcare facilities Canada.</p>

<p>The emergency department serves as the primary entry point for patients experiencing urgent or life-threatening conditions. Walk-in patients are triaged by registered nurses who assess symptom severity, vital signs, and clinical urgency to determine the order of care. Ambulance arrivals are coordinated with paramedic services and receive immediate handover to emergency physicians and nursing teams. For non-urgent concerns, patients are encouraged to consult primary care providers or community health services when available, in line with provincial guidance on appropriate use of emergency room services. This approach helps ensure that emergency resources are reserved for those with the greatest clinical need while supporting continuity across the Canadian hospital network.</p>

<p>Referral pathways connect patients with specialist medical care for conditions that require advanced diagnostics, subspecialty expertise, or coordinated treatment plans. Primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and other healthcare providers initiate referrals by submitting clinical summaries, test results, and specific questions to the appropriate specialty service. Centenary Hospital appointments are scheduled based on clinical priority, with urgent cases receiving expedited access and routine consultations arranged within recommended wait-time benchmarks. Patients are advised to bring referral documentation, prior imaging or laboratory reports, and a list of current medications to support efficient assessment and care planning. For more details on scheduling and preparation, please visit our <a href="/faq">FAQ on appointments</a>.</p>

<h3>Planned admissions and inpatient access</h3>

<p>Planned admissions are arranged for patients requiring elective surgery, scheduled diagnostic procedures, or inpatient treatment for chronic conditions that cannot be managed in outpatient settings. The hospital admission process for planned cases includes pre-admission assessments, patient education sessions, and coordination with surgical or procedural teams to confirm readiness and optimize outcomes. Patients receive detailed instructions on fasting, medication adjustments, and what to bring on the day of admission. Transportation planning and caregiver support are also discussed to ensure safe discharge and recovery at home. This structured approach reflects best practices in acute care hospital management and aligns with standards promoted by <a href="https://www.ontariohealth.ca/" rel="external">Ontario Health</a> and other provincial health authorities.</p>

<h3>Accessibility and language support</h3>
<p>Centenary Hospital is committed to removing barriers to care for patients with disabilities, language needs, or other access challenges. Interpretation services are available for patients who speak languages other than English or French, and accessibility accommodations—including mobility aids, hearing loops, and visual supports—are provided upon request. Patients and families are encouraged to identify their needs during registration or appointment booking so that appropriate resources can be arranged in advance. Our goal is to ensure that every individual can participate fully in their care and make informed decisions in partnership with clinical teams.</p>

<h2>Quality, safety, and coordinated inpatient hospital services</h2>

<h3>Safety practices and patient participation</h3>

<p>Centenary Hospital Canada prioritizes quality and safety across all inpatient hospital services, emergency care, and diagnostic functions. Our acute care hospital teams follow evidence-based protocols for medication reconciliation, infection prevention, diagnostic stewardship, and discharge planning to minimize risks, prevent errors, and support optimal recovery. These practices are embedded in daily workflows and reinforced through staff education, clinical audits, and performance monitoring aligned with national standards and international best practices from organizations such as the <a href="https://www.ihi.org/" rel="external">Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI)</a>.</p>

<p>Medication reconciliation is a critical safety process that occurs at every transition of care—admission, transfer between units, and discharge. Clinical pharmacists and nursing staff review all medications a patient is taking, compare them with newly prescribed treatments, and resolve discrepancies to prevent adverse drug events. Patients play an essential role by providing accurate, up-to-date medication lists, including over-the-counter products, supplements, and known allergies. This collaborative approach reduces the risk of harmful interactions and ensures that treatment plans are safe and effective throughout the hospital stay and beyond.</p>

<p>Infection prevention and control measures protect patients, visitors, and healthcare workers from healthcare-associated infections. Centenary Hospital implements hand hygiene protocols, environmental cleaning standards, and isolation precautions based on the latest guidance from public health authorities. Patients and families are encouraged to practice hand hygiene upon entering and leaving patient rooms, to follow posted masking or gown requirements, and to ask questions if they observe practices that concern them. Transparency and shared responsibility are key to maintaining a safe care environment within healthcare facilities Canada.</p>

<h3>Hospital laboratory services and diagnostic stewardship</h3>

<p>Hospital laboratory services are integral to diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and care planning across emergency and inpatient settings. Centenary Hospital laboratories perform a wide range of tests—including bloodwork, microbiology cultures, pathology specimens, and specialized assays—to support clinical decision-making. Diagnostic stewardship ensures that tests are ordered appropriately, interpreted accurately, and used to guide evidence-based interventions. Patients can participate by asking how specific tests inform their care, what results mean, and what follow-up actions are recommended. This dialogue fosters understanding and empowers patients to be active partners in their health journey.</p>

<p>Results from hospital laboratory services are reviewed by attending physicians, specialists, and interprofessional care teams who integrate findings into comprehensive treatment plans. Abnormal or critical values trigger immediate clinical responses, while routine results inform ongoing monitoring and adjustments to therapy. Laboratory data also contribute to quality improvement initiatives, infection surveillance, and research that advances medical knowledge and patient outcomes. For more information on health services and patient safety, visit <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/health.html" rel="external">Government of Canada: Patient safety and health information</a>.</p>

<h3>Discharge planning and continuity of care</h3>

<p>Discharge planning begins at admission and involves the entire care team, the patient, and their family or caregivers. The goal is to ensure a safe transition from hospital to home, rehabilitation facility, or other care settings, with clear instructions, follow-up appointments, and support services in place. Discharge coordinators work with social workers, community agencies, and home care providers to arrange equipment, medications, and ongoing monitoring as needed. Patients are educated on warning signs that require medical attention, medication schedules, activity restrictions, and self-care strategies to promote recovery and prevent readmissions.</p>

<p>Effective discharge planning reduces the risk of complications, hospital readmissions, and gaps in care. Patients and families are encouraged to ask questions, confirm understanding of instructions, and identify any barriers to following the discharge plan—such as transportation challenges, language needs, or lack of caregiver support. By addressing these issues proactively, Centenary Hospital helps ensure continuity of care and supports long-term health and well-being. For additional questions about the hospital admission process, visiting hours, or follow-up care, please consult our <a href="/faq">frequently asked questions</a> or contact the hospital directly.</p>
